## Security Best Practices Used in This Project

We take security seriously and have implemented several measures to protect the application:

- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  All sensitive routes are protected using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication. Only authorized users with appropriate roles can access protected resources.
  
- **Password Management:**  
  Passwords are stored securely using **bcrypt** hashing to ensure that even if the database is compromised, the passwords remain protected.

- **Input Validation:**  
  We use input validation libraries such as **Joi** to validate user inputs and prevent injection attacks and malformed data.

- **HTTPS:**  
  We recommend deploying the application over HTTPS to ensure that all data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and protected from man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Helmet:**  
  The app uses **Helmet.js** to secure HTTP headers, protecting against a variety of attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting, clickjacking, etc.).

- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**  
  CORS is enabled with proper configurations to limit which external origins can interact with the API.

- **Logging:**  
  We log critical events using **Winston** for monitoring and auditing. Sensitive information such as passwords and tokens are never logged.

## Security Updates

We make security updates as necessary. You can monitor updates and releases via the repository’s **release page** or **security mailing list** (if applicable).

By following this process, we ensure that security issues are reported, addressed, and resolved quickly and effectively.
